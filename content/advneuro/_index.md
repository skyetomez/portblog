The notes here are advanced for the reason that they border between neuroscience, biology and mathematics and intermediate background in all three at least is recommended or and advanced understanding of at least two of the three. The notes here are compilation of course notes, book notes, and exercises from my time at university. The books used are **Neuroscience** by Purves et al., **Computational Neuroscience** by Dyan and Abbot, my notes and work from a course on artifical neural networks (ANNs), **Infinite-Dimensional Dynamical Systems: An Introduction to Dissipative Parabolic Pdes and the Theory of Global Attractors** by Robinson, and various papers used in my course that I will link or cut excerpts from. If you see something improperly credited or have a better source or notes to refer to, do not hesitate to submit them to me.
