		I enjoy reading-- anything -- fiction, non-fiction, nutrition labels, people. If it can be read, I should like to read it or at least add it to my list of books to read. Some particular topics that I enjoy to read about are: mysteries, satirical fiction, intersting narratives, the philosophy of mathematics or knowledge, and the history of scientific thought. You can see what I am currently or going to read through my <a href= " https://www.goodreads.com/skylxrkt"> goodreads </a> account.
